## 这是什么
这是一个高考模拟试卷题库
## 目前试卷库很多为什么要再建立一个？
这是一个好问题，比如一数出的笔袋app，其他优秀试卷库不在少数，但按试卷地区分类的试卷库几乎没有，而且大部分还需要掏钱，所以我想来用微薄之力来解决部分问题。
## 资源来源以及是否收费
大部分将来自**UP主-筱雅key的学习资源站**[https://docs.qq.com/sheet/DTkRSbGFZRWhnb1Z2?tab=zs3f7s] ,十分感谢这样up主的付出与努力。
现在不会将来也不会，我是2024届高考考生，知道赚钱不易，我几乎除了时间外没有任何损失，存储空间由GitHub承担，我也有本人的服务器和自己的网站，并且有资金去运营下去
## 更新频率
不会太高，我是住校生，只能回家更新，本项目遵循MIT协议，你可以向我的项目提交PR，有问题可以建立议题。

## What is it
It's a bank of GCSE mock exam papers.
## There are plenty of question paper banks at the moment why create another one?
It's a good question, for example the pencil bag app out by One Count, there are a handful of other good question paper banks, but almost none by paper region, and most of them require money out of pocket, so I thought I'd come and solve part of the problem in a small way.
## Sources and whether to charge for them
Most of them will come from **UP owner - Shinya Key's study resource site**[https://docs.qq.com/sheet/DTkRSbGFZRWhnb1Z2?tab=zs3f7s] ,thanks a lot for the dedication and efforts of such up owners.
I won't now and won't ever, I'm a 2024 GCSE candidate and know it's not easy to make money, I have almost nothing to lose but my time, storage space is covered by GitHub, I also have my own server and my own website, and have the funds to run it on
## Update Frequency
Not too often, I'm a resident student and can only update at home, this project follows the MIT protocol, you can submit PRs to my project and create topics if you have questions.
